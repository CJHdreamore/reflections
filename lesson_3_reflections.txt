point 1 :
When you initialize the repository,git doesn't create any commits.That's to say,when we create a reponsitory,the 
number of commits is 0!!

point 2:

when you create a new repository,cause there is 0 commit.
So you can't use [git log] to track.
Here,[git status] is useful.It shows which files have changed since the last commit.

Point 3:
new concepts:  repository, working directory,staging area
in our working directory:there are some files
use[git init]: we create a empty repository,with no commit
use[git add]: we add some of our files into the staging 
area,the rest files are still leave in our working directory without tracking by git.

Point 4:

how to modify files in working directory and then commit them to correct bugs?

if I modified some files in my working directory
use [git diff] with no ids, it shows the differences between working directory & staging area.
use [git diff --staged] to show the differences between
staging area & the latest commit

if i run [git reset --hard], i discards any changes in working directory and staging area.

Point 5:  debug game.js in asteriod
find the bug in game.js 
correct the wrong line and save.
[git add game.js]add changed game.js into staging area
[git commit] to commit the new version of our code.

Point 6: the idea of branch

you can create different branches towards one project.
For example,create a branch called [easy mode] for the 
asteroids game. 

[git branch easy-mode]: create the new branch
[git checkout easy-mode]: on the easy-mode branch
then we can make some change in the game.js
[git add game.js] to staging area
[git commit]: commit the new version.

Point 7:
head: means the current commit.

log: error in merge!!!! do it tomorrow!!!

2017.7.26：
fix the error in merge!!
git reset --hard commit-id : delete the commit after the commit-id

branch is just a label refer to a commit.

Conflicts when merging: 

Git don't know how to merge when the code in two branches is simutaneously changed, that's why a conclict occurs.

Then we should check the code and to find the differences.
So we can decide the final change to the same code.

After this, we can [git add xx.js] to our staging area
Finally,[git commit] to the repository by solving the conflict.
