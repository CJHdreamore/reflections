point 1 :
When you initialize the repository,git doesn't create any commits.That's to say,when we create a reponsitory,the 
number of commits is 0!!

point 2:

when you create a new repository,cause there is 0 commit.
So you can't use [git log] to track.
Here,[git status] is useful.It shows which files have changed since the last commit.

Point 3:
new concepts:  repository, working directory,staging area
in our working directory:there are some files
use[git init]: we create a empty repository,with no commit
use[git add]: we add some of our files into the staging 
area,the rest files are still leave in our working directory without tracking by git.
